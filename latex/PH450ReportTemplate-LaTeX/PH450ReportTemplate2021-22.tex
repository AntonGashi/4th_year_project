\section{Introduction}

  \subsection{Sub-Pixel Localisation} % (fold)
  \label{sub:spot-finding intro}
  
  Super-resolution microscopy is the process of taking the diffraction limit 
  of a microscope, ~250nm in the x and y direction, and improving it at a minimum by a 
  factor of 2 although more modern methods improve it by up to a factor of 10. In the past this has been achieved by ensemble techniques
  like SIM (Structured Illumination Microscopy) and STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion)
  \textbf{insert explanation of ensemble techniques}. An improvement on these methods 
  is single-molecule microscopy, in which molecules are individually fluoresced and 
  imaged instead of ensembles which helps distinguish more detail and produce better
  results than the diffraction limit.
  There are two ways that this general method have been implemented; photo-activated localization
  microscopy(PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy(STORM), both
  rely on fluorophores which are fluorescent chemicals that re-emit light after
  being excited. This helps as the fluorescence emits the light 
  stochastically so only a subset of molecules "light-up" at once, this is important 
  as if they are separated by at least 200nm then they can be located to nanometre precision. 
  Since the molecules are now separated spatially this process needs to just needs to be repeated 
  until all molecules have been "switched-on", this gives a stack of images with blurry spots
  which can be located and recombined into a final image with spot-precision on the order of <~20nm.\cite{galbraith2011super}
  The resolution of a super-resolution image usually doesn't refer to the spot-precision of the 
  located molecule, rather it refers to the structural resolution, this can be calculated along 
  with the density of fluorophores as the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states a minimum number 
  of fluorophores are required to resolve the structure (equation \ref{resolution_equation}). \cite{van2011single}\cite{shannon1949communication}

  \subsubsection{Pixels and Resolution} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:Pixel}
   In the Modern Dictionary of Electronics by Graf a pixel is described as a, 
   spatial resolution element.
   The smallest distinguishable and resolvable area in an image.
   \cite{graf1997modern}
   This was mainly in reference to an analog image but the principle applies 
   to a raster image, which is a $N\cdot M$ matrix of values that display colour and
   intensity. In the specific case of the spot localisation that the Methods section 
   (\ref{sec:Methods}) describe the images are $N\cdot N$ and 16-bit black and white.

   Resolution is the capability of resolving two points or lines.
   Since super-resolution by definition changes the resolution of the input images, 
   the resolution of the output image needs to be quantified.
   Firstly the uncertainty of a spatial measurement is set by the equation;
   \begin{equation}\label{PSFequation}
   \sigma_{x,y}\sim\frac{\sigma_{PSF}}{\sqrt{N}}
   \end{equation}

   Where $\sigma_{PSF}$ is the standard deviation of the point spread function (PSF)
   for the microscope, and $N$ is the number of detected photons per florescent event.
   Since the relationship of equation \ref{PSFequation} is approximately the inverse square root, 
   the more detected photons the lower the uncertainty becomes.\cite{DEMPSEY2013561}
   One of the ways to do this is by using the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem,
   this states that any detail in a measurement that is smaller than twice the size of the 
   average label to label distance can reliably be resolved.\cite{tinnefeld2015far}
   The Nyquist resolution limit can be written formally as; 
   \begin{equation}\label{resolution_equation}
     \textrm{Nyquist resolution limit} \/\ =\frac{2}{N^{\frac{1}{D}}}
   \end{equation}

   Where $N$ is the density of labels, and $D$ is the dimensionality. 
   Labels in this specific case refers to each individual fluorescent event that is 
   detected by the camera, the density of labels is sometimes constrained by the 
   molecules being detected as if the structure that's trying to be detected is too
   sparse the uncertainty remains relatively high. 
   For example if the resolution was required to be 20nm in 
   one dimension then fluorophores have to be separated at least 10nm apart at a density of 
   $~10^4\mu m^{-2}$ at a minimum to achieve it.
   The final resulting uncertainty of the image is therefor the maximum of either equation (\ref{PSFequation}) or (\ref{resolution_equation}). 


   \subsubsection{Fluorophores} % (fold)
   \label{ssub:Fluorophores}
   
   Single molecule super-resolution demands the switching of fluorophores
   stochastically, this can be done reversibly or irreversibly. Reversible switching fluorophores
   are photo-activated and emit light until it becomes non-fluorescent again unless reactivated.  
   Irreversible switching fluorophores either start in the off state or the on state, if it 
   starts in an off state it can be photo-activated and turned on then after a period of 
   time it becomes bleached. If it starts switched on then it can be further excited 
   and transition to a red-shifted state.\cite{van2011single}

   According to equation \ref{resolution_equation} the resolution is increased 
   if the number density $N$ is increased, although in order to locate or find a spot 
   in a diffraction limited image the spots need to be spaced apart. 
   Therefor the rate at which populations are on or off can be denoted by $k_{on}$ and 
   $k_{off}$, also the rate at which the fluorophores switch to the on and off states matter 
   and are denoted as $\tau_{on}$ and $\tau_{off}$. The switch rates are directly linked with 
   how many excitations can be detected at once and thus are linked with the ability to 
   accurately find the location of each spot. Ratios between on and off states are denoted as 
   $r=\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}=\frac{\tau_{off}}{\tau_{on}}$, the larger the ratio, r, the more 
   accurate results can be up until a point.
   

  \subsection{Motivation} % (fold)
  \label{sub:Motivation}
  
  The main motivation behind my project is to improve the compute time that it
  takes to render images through sub-pixel localisation whilst keeping an
  acceptable level of accuracy. That is to say this project should be aiming to
  produce a method of spot-finding that either less complex, less computations
  per localisation, fewer steps or a mixture of all. 

  The applications of spot finding reach far beyond localisation microscopy it 
  can be used in other technologies, for example a paper published by Castorena and Creusere \cite{6638050}
  has the problem of needing a fast super-resolution technique to get higher 
  spatial resolution from their LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system. This system is constrained by the 
  laser spot size and precision of the scanning mechanical unit as the single laser 
  source with sampling rates in the GHz range which achieves high accuracy for depth 
  and range resolution but poor spatial resolution. A consideration was to decrease the 
  diameter of the laser thus increasing the spatial sampling density, although this 
  was deemed too computationally expensive.
  
  With the almost exponentially increasing launching of small form factor
  satellites such as the CubeSat, arises the challenge of efficiently utilising
  the satellites computing resources. This means any segment of code being ran on
  the satellite needs to run as quickly as possible whilst keeping a certain
  standard of accuracy, especially for the processes that the satellite depends
  on to operate like attitude control, power management and calculations for
  orbital maneuvers. The main method used for orienting(attitude control) CubSat
  like satellites is by using a Star Tracker, this works by using a camera mounted
  facing stars that are known to the satellite via a star catalogue and moves
  based on how aligned or unaligned a reference image is with the actual image
  seen.\cite{calitz2015design} The method in which the image is processed so it
  can be compared to the reference is called spot finding, this entails taking
  the image and finding each bright spot or star accurately. The motivation for
  this project is to develop a spot finding method for star tracking and compare
  it to the state of the art algorithms measuring accuracy, precision and speed.

  This technique is also used for super-resolution microscopy, which changes the
  optical limits of microscopy from 250nm to about 10nm, this is achieved by
  temporally or spatially spacing the light coming from the specimen being
  imaged. 

  \textbf{still need to add more technologies that use spot localisation}
  
  \subsection{Literature Review (don't call it literature review)} % (fold)
  \label{sub:Literature Review (don't call it literature review)}
  
  
  The field of spot finding or star finding is a fairly recent field with papers
  coming out in the mid 80's from NASA. However the methods haven't changed that
  much since the main algorithm still used is centroiding since it's a very good
  compromise between quickness and accuracy being that it can give an answer in
  the 1-100 microsecond range \cite{delabie2014accurate}. Much of the innovation
  has come from optimising the algorithm or optimising the data going into the
  algorithm. 


\section{Methods} % (fold)
\label{sec:Methods}

  \subsection{Centroiding} % (fold)
  \label{sub:Centroiding_meth}
  
  % subsection subsection name (end)
  
  
  The most common way of spot finding for star tracking is to use centroiding
  algorithms, this is when a subsection of pixels are considered to be a star
  using a rough calculation. The area of interest is then filtered in such a way
  that reduces noise and aberrations, finally apply the algorithm in this case
  it's the center of gravity method (\ref{eq1})(or the moment
  method)\cite{delabie2014accurate}\cite{stone1989comparison}.
  \begin{equation}\label{eq1}
      (x_b,y_b) = \left( {\frac{\sum_{ij} I_{ij}x_{ij}}{\sum_{ij} I_{ij}},\frac{\sum_{ij} I_{ij}y_{ij}}{\sum_{ij} I_{ij}}}\right)
  \end{equation}
  
  As can be seen in equation \ref{eq1} the centroiding method is fairly trivial, 
  the part that determines the computational operations needed is the i and j terms. 
  These terms are the 'window' of pixels that have been chosen by another rough estimator 
  to get a generalised position, the window is a square around the estimated position so 
  the computation scales like $n^2$, where n is the window size.\cite{stone1989comparison}
  
  \subsection{Fitting methods} % (fold)
  \label{sub:Various fitting methods}

  \subsubsection{Point Spread Function} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:Point Spread Function}
    
    Point Spread Functions(PSF) is the way an object blurs due to the imaging of a point 
    source of light, it's the reason the diffraction limit of a microscope is 250nm (in the
    x,y direction) and >450-700nm (in the z direction).\cite{galbraith2011super} The PSF is also the smallest resolvable
    detail that can be seen with light as other objects that emit light that are smaller than 
    one another all appear to be the same size. Provided that laboratory equipment is set up correctly, 
    i.e. the lens is corrected for aberrations and constants are known such as aperture and angels 
    between lens and samples, methods like the Richards-Wolf model and Gibson-Lanni model will calculate
    the centre of a spot near perfectly. The problem with these methods is that they are complicated and 
    slow, and also offer an answer that is unnecessarily accurate. \cite{richards1959electromagnetic}\cite{small2014fluorophore}


    % subsubsection Point Spread Function (end)
    \subsubsection{Gaussian} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:Gaussian}

    Where the exact prediction of section (\ref{ssub:Point Spread Function}) fails Gaussian fitting tries to succeed 
    by presuming that, if all equipment is set up correctly, the centre of a PSF of a point source is 
    always going to be in the centre. Thus for 2-D spot finding that can't afford the computational time of 
    the previous method uses the more simple equation:

    $$I(x,y)=I_0\cdot \exp(-a\cdot k^2((x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2))+b$$

    Where k is $\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, $a$ is the width of the PSF, $I_0$ is the peak intensity and b is the average background per pixel. \cite{small2014fluorophore}

    
    \subsubsection{Triangular method} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:Triangular method}
    
    The triangle method being used takes inspiration from the Gaussian method, in which,
    a Gaussian curve is produced and the area is calculated by integrating the function. 
    After this the position of the spot is estimated by a hyper-parameter optimisation method 
    which minimises the residual area left over from the fitting process.
    This triangle method looks to reduce the computational load by removing the integration step, 
    this can be done as the area of a triangle is just $\frac{1}{2}\ base\cdot height$. 
    On top of this, the method also sums pixel intensities across axis, firstly it gives a 
    better signal to noise ratio but also it means the triangle only needs to be rendered in 2 dimensions 
    instead of 3, further reducing the computational time.

      \caption{Graph of data from figure \ref{fig:visual_test_2} with the calculated area and residual}
      \label{fig:visual_test}
    \end{figure}
    
    As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:visual_test} the area of the simulated spot are subtracted from 
    the area under the triangle and a residual is left over, this residual parameter is the 
    variable to be minimised for in the optimisation routine.

      \caption{Flowchart describing how the code for the triangular fitting method works}
      \label{fig:flowchart}
    \end{figure}
    
    Once the triangle algorithm was implemented it was tested on TIFF stacks of 100 images 
    of perfect spot data. The absolute error (Euclidean distance) was calculated from each 
    axis and plotted as seen in figure \ref{fig:single_histo} A. In image B a histogram 
    was produced so that the spread was more visible.

\section{Results and analysis} % (fold)
\label{sec:Results}

  \subsection{Centroiding} % (fold)
  \label{sub:Centroiding_results}

  For the centroiding method box sizes of 3, 5, 7 and 11 were used in the production 
  of the histograms pertaining to the absolute error, this was done for the noisy data as 
  well. The rest of the data not presented in the main body of text is available in the appendix 
  section (\ref{sec:appendix}).

  The results of the centroiding algorithm in figure \ref{fig:box_3} show a fairly poor 
  level of accuracy, ranging from a $0\rightarrow 1.5$ pixel error approximately. This lack of accuracy 
  is especially pronounced the larger the radii of spot, the reason for this increasing 
  error is due to the spots being larger in the same sized 50x50 images. The radii of the 
  airy disk that was used to generate the spots is 'physically' larger than the box size 
  that the centroiding is using. This holds true for the radii that are larger than R1.5 
  as the box size's diameter, as well as the diameter of the airy disk, is 3 pixels. The further 
  increase of inaccuracy seen in figure \ref{fig:box_3} R4.00, R5.66 and R8.00 is due to the 
  3x3 box being placed roughly where the centre of the spot already is, then the algorithm is 
  ran which in essence takes the average of the intensities. This 3x3 box is not given a reasonable 
  range of intensities to average over thus the method will be less likely to give the correct answer,
  this instead gives a range of answers from $0\rightarrow 1.5$ pixels approximately as if the 
  local maximum finder roughly gives an answer the centroiding algorithm will only give and answer 
  that is 1.5 pixels off of that guess. Since in this perfect data that only has one spot per image, the 
  local maximum finder will predict where the spot is to a single pixel of accuracy thus the maximum 
  error seen should indeed be fractionally larger than 1.5 pixels as observed.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{project_pics/distro_centriod_3.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Histograms of the absolute error from each radii with a box size of 3x3 pixels. Completed in 0.19s}
    \label{fig:box_3}
  \end{figure}

  In figure \ref{fig:box_3_noise} noisy spot data was provided to test out the algorithms on, 
  these spot were the same as before but with read noise at 1 electron, average photon number 
  per spot at 2000 and dark current at 0.1 electron per pixel and cg? Also the number of radii 
  were reduced, R1.00 and R1.41 were removed. These noise values were chosen 
  to replicate real world noise levels in order to test all algorithms in isolation from any other 
  variables so that the spot finding methods could be objectively observed. 

  The noisy data for the 3x3 centroid box size did not have a pronounced impact on average 
  accuracy per radii. This again is due to the size of the box being small relative to the 
  size of the spots, thus mostly not allowing the noise to play a part in the calculation of the 
  centre of the spot. One difference that the noisy data does seem to show is that it gives a more 
  even spread of answers around it's average, this suggests that although the noisy data 
  is not changing the average it is having an effect on the centroiding algorithm. The limiting factor 
  in this case is the box size in which the algorithm is interested in.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{project_pics/noise_cen_scatter_3.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Histograms of the absolute error from each radii with a box size of 3x3 pixels, also with noise.}
    \label{fig:box_3_noise}
  \end{figure}
  


  In figure \ref{fig:box_11} the box size used was 11x11, this increases the sub-pixel localisation 
  drastically compared to figure \ref{fig:box_3}. The spread of all answers is smaller using 11x11 instead of using 3x3
  boxes, the spread also changes with radii sequentially getting larger along with the average. 
  This is due to the larger box size being able to fit 
  more pixels in to average over effectively, this is clearly evident in the R5.66 and R8.00 histogram as there is a 
  significant jump in inaccuracy as the radii is still larger than the radii of the box. 

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{project_pics/distro_centriod_11.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Histograms of the absolute error from each radii with a box size of 11x11 pixels.}
    \label{fig:box_11}
  \end{figure}
  
  In figure \ref{fig:box_11_noise} when centroiding was used on the noisy data with an 11x11 box size, 
  on average the accuracy decreased as expected and gave a similar average error for each radii apart from R8.00. 
  Again this will be due to the fact that the R8.00 spot will not fit into the box size being calculated 
  but also in relation to the spot, as the size of the spot increases so to does the noise in the images 
  provided.


  \begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Histograms of the absolute error from each radii with a box size of 11x11 pixels, also with noise.}
    \label{fig:box_11_noise}
  \end{figure}
  
  In figure \ref{fig:box_var_r8} the box size for making the centroiding calculation 
  was varied from 3 to 49 $\textrm{pixels}^2$ in odd increments, this was tested to understand the 
  relationship between box size and accuracy. In general the larger the box size the more accuracy 
  gained this was expected especially for the perfect data as there was only one spot per image, 
  although this would be impractical for real data as spot are more than likely to be closer than 
  $\approx 15$ pixels. \textbf{try and talk about the sin nature of the plot}


  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{project_pics/box_size_var_r8.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Showing the accuracy of centroiding Vs the box size chosen, for a radii or R8.00.}
    \label{fig:box_var_r8}
  \end{figure}

  Figure \ref{fig:noise_box_r8}, similar to figure \ref{fig:box_var_r8}, shows the accuracy of the 
  centroid method against the varying box size, but on a set of noisy data. Here it can be seen that 
  for a period of box size increases the accuracy also increases, then it minimises and then decreases indefinitely.
  Presumably this specific box size minimises the error at $\approx 15$ pixels due to the radii being R8.00, 
  as each spot seems to be most optimised at double it's radii. This makes sense as if the centre is 
  what the algorithm is looking for then it should look exactly where that spot is ideally, presuming 
  there are other artefacts in the image like noise.

  \subsection{Triangle Fitting} % (fold)
  \label{sub:Triangle Fitting}

  In figure \ref{fig:single_test} it can be seen that while using simulated data the mean accuracy of the 
  localisation is ~0.4 of a pixel whilst being executed in ~0.34s.

  Part C of figure \ref{fig:single_test} has been replicated for all simulated spots given in figure \ref{fig:no_noise_all_r}
  to compare how the change in spot size changes accuracy.

As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:distro_noise}, compared with figure \ref{fig:distro}, the distribution
of results is shifted towards being less accurate. This is expected as noise adds randomness and 
variability into the system, giving extra information that does not aid in the process of finding the 
centre of a spot.
